				<h1> About Us</h1>
				<div id="details">
				<p>CarWorld started with a vision by two college students. When, now CarWorld co-founders, Giovanni and Sergio were in need of a car, they realized that car shopping was more complicated than it should be. With so many car companies looking for excellent credit only to provide mediocre cars, Giovanni and Sergio set out to change the standard in car sales. They set out to offer a wide variety of cars, ranging from minivans to exotic sport cars to pretty much anyone with a job. Regardless of your credit rating, CarWorld has a car for you. Now, with a single, but thriving location, they want to expand their business to bring great car deals to you!</p>
				<div id="gioDetail">
				Giovanni is Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona graduating with a Bachelor's in Science.
				Even though he's a programmer, Giovanni has always had a creative side.  With a passion to create a product for the customer, Giovanni began his career by making mobile game apps for customers. One of his favorite hobby was cars, and as soon as he met Sergio, they came up with the idea of CarWorld.
